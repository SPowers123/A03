PART 1: Directions on Using Webstorm.

Bold each of the Glossary words as you use them.  Bold ONLY the glossary word.

In order to use webstorm with GIT you first need to install it from jetbrains at the link https://www.jetbrains.com/student/4 . Then **GIT** will need to be downloaded from https://git-scm.com/downloads. Once both are downloaded go to webstorm and use the shortcut (Ctrl+Alt+S) for system preferences. Once there the version control software should be seet to GIT. To create a **repository** click the + sign in the upper right hand corner to choose "Create repository". Now that this is all set up **commits** can start being made by simply clicking the **commit** button at the bottom of the page. To **push** a changee to the repository Click “Ctrl> shift >K” or go to the version control software tab in settings, going to **GIT** and then pressing **push**.
